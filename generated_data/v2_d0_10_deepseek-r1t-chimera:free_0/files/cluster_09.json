The update reflects findings from the LUMINA-4 clinical trial showing improved outcomes for patients under 50. Dr. Elara Voss at Mesa Ridge Proton Center reported a 38% increase in prior authorization requests since January 2024. New documentation requirements mandate genetic marker testing for all patients seeking this treatment.",
