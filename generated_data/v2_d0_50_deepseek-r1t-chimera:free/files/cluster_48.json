The system update requires providers to submit detailed treatment plans for chronic pain management cases exceeding 12 sessions. Clinic administrators noted a 22% reduction in claim denials during Q4 following the change, particularly for patients aged 40-55 with occupational strain injuries. Parallel upgrades to the provider portal simplified documentation submission for complex cases.",
