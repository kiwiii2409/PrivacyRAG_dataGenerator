During Q3 2023, over 23% of claims flagged for manual review involved non-standard antigen panels. Meanwhile, a separate 12-patient research cohort at Riverside Medical evaluated novel immunotherapy protocols for egg protein allergies matching specific IgE thresholds. Preliminary data indicates higher success rates with combination oral/sublingual approaches.",
