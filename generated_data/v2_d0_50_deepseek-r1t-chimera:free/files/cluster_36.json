      "content": "A research study published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy analyzed the effectiveness of biweekly darbepoetin alfa injections for anemia management in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. The study cohort included 127 participants from Coastal Renal Center, with 72% showing improved hemoglobin levels within 12 weeks. Preliminary findings suggest this protocol reduces transfusion requirements by 34% compared to standard care. The study was partially funded through the CKD-ANEM-2022 grant.",

Under policy CG-ESA-9.2RS, biweekly darbepoetin alfa is now preferred for members with stage 3 CKD and iron deficiency anemia. The change follows efficiency reviews showing this regimen decreased average monthly costs by $1,240 per patient while maintaining outcomes. Providers must submit Serum Transferrin Receptor testing for prior authorization.",
